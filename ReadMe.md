# Introduction:
In this  project, we will  perfom some basic probability principles on an e-commerce  dataset  to have a deeper understanding  of it. Then,  we will perform an AB test to help the company knows if the  customers are landing in the newly designed website page or they  will  stay   in the old one. Further,  to  assure that  the AB test is  reliable, we will  perform a logistic regression model and  find its results.

# Datasets:
   #### we have  2 datasets that we  will use in this investigation:
   *  the first one is a data set of  an ecommerce  company that will  be used  to  have the A/B  test perfomed on 
   *  the second one is considered  to be an extension  of the  first one and it contains the countries data  that will be       joined to the first one  at the logistic  regression  part
   

# Project goal:
 This project aims to:
 *  apply basic probability  to understand the  datasets and the proportions in it
 *  applying an AB test  to check if the customers are landing in the new page  or still using the old page of the website
 * applying a  logistic  regression model  to assure  the  results of the A/B test
 * continuing  with the  Logistic  reg. model for  the  countries data
